# Data quality report 

## Obejctive 
Ensure that data is reliable before onboarding, avoiding importing obsolete accounts into CyberArk.

## Approach 
As a BA, I use SQL scripts to cross-reference HR data (from Workday: EmployeeID, Department) with AD to identify accounts that are not linked to an active employee (e.g. orphans, departed contractors). This also incorporates Splunk logs to detect suspicious activity.
I supervise SQL queries (e.g. JOIN between HR and AD tables on EmployeeID) and apply data quality rules (e.g. completeness, uniqueness) to quantify problems.
I work with HR teams to gain access to Workday, with DB developers to check SQL scripts, and with SIEM analysts for correlation with Splunk.

## Tools
- SQL
- Splunk logs
