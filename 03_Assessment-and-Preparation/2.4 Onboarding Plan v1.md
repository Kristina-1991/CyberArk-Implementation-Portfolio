# Onboarding Preparation and Documentation

## Objective 
Provide a clear roadmap, minimising risks during implementation.

## Approach 

From an IAM BA perspective, I developed the v1 onboarding plan for CyberArk, prioritising risks and aligning with assessment results.

### Onboarding waves

- Wave 1 (Weeks 1-4): Critical on-premise accounts (e.g. AD admins, Euroclear trading servers).
- Wave 2 (Weeks 5-8): Cloud accounts (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL) and identified orphan accounts.
- Wave 3 (Weeks 9-12): Generic accounts and Sailpoint/Entra ID integration for automation. Each wave includes testing, training, and monitoring via Splunk.

### Priorities 

- High: Business-critical resources (risk score >8/10, based on business impact).
- Medium: Orphan accounts with recent activity (Splunk logs).
- Low: Non-critical legacy accounts. Criteria: Impact (financial/security), urgency (known vulnerabilities), and effort (easy integration via API).
