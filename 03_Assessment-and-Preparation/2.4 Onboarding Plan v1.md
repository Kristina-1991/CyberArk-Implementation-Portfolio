# Onboarding Preparation and Documentation

## Objective 
Provide a clear roadmap, minimising risks during implementation.

## Approach 

My role as a BA is to compile the results into operational deliverables (inventory, quality report, definitions, onboarding plan) in order to move on to the next phase.

To do this, I write reports, prioritise the implementation of accounts in waves (e.g. wave 1 for critical accounts), and validate with the project team (PM, CyberArk architects) the integration with Sailpoint/Entra ID for automated governance.

This phase typically lasts 4-8 weeks, depending on the size of the company, and lays the foundation for secure onboarding.
