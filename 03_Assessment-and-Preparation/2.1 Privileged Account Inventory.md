# Privileged Account Inventory 

## Objective 
Create an initial inventory to detect blind spots and prioritise onboarding.

## Approach 
As an IAM Business Analyst, I coordinate the extraction of AD data to identify accounts with elevated privileges (e.g., members of groups such as Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins). This includes generic, orphaned, or high-risk accounts.
I work with AD admins for extraction, application owners for resource lists, and cloud teams (AWS/Azure) for IaC (Infrastructure as Code) inventories.

## Tools 
- Powershell for the AD data extraction
- Sql
- The list of critical resources
