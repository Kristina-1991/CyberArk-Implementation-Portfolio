# Privileged Account Inventory 

## Objective 
Create an initial inventory to detect blind spots and prioritise onboarding.

## Approach 
As an IAM Business Analyst, I led the privileged account inventory phase during the implementation of CyberArk, ensuring comprehensive coverage to avoid blind spots.
I collaborated with AD administrators to extract data via PowerShell scripts, targeting accounts that were members of high-privilege groups (e.g., Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins). At the same time, I asked application owners for lists of critical resources, such as trading servers (Euroclear) and cloud instances (AWS RDS, Azure SQL). SQL scripts were used to cross-reference this data with HR information from Workday, identifying orphaned accounts or those not linked to an active EmployeeID. This multi-source approach (AD, Workday, owner lists) enabled comprehensive mapping.

### Data sources (demo)

- AD user export (sample) : [Link]
- Membership in privileged groups (sample).
- HR roster (sample).

### Pipeline

1) Load CSV into a lightweight SQL database (`iam_phase0_demo.db`).  
2) Run reconciliation queries (AD â†” HR) and privileged membership checks.  
3) Export results as evidence (CSV + screenshots from your SQL tool).



## Results
The inventory revealed a total of 850 privileged accounts, including 150 generic/orphaned accounts (18% of the total), 300 linked to critical servers, and 400 linked to cloud environments. Among these, 25% presented high risks due to rights that had not been reviewed for more than six months. These results served as the basis for prioritising onboarding, avoiding the import of obsolete accounts into CyberArk.

## Tools 
- Powershell for the AD data extraction
- Sql
- The list of critical resources
