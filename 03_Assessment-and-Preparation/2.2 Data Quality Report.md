# Data quality report 

## Obejctive 
Ensure that data is reliable before onboarding, avoiding importing obsolete accounts into CyberArk.

## Approach 
From an IAM Business Analyst's perspective, data quality reporting is essential to ensure the reliability of information prior to onboarding into CyberArk. I oversaw this analysis to identify and correct inconsistencies in the AS-IS ecosystem (Workday, Sailpoint, Entra ID, AD, Splunk).

### Data quality rules 

I have defined rules based on standard dimensions (DAMA):

- **Completeness:** All AD accounts must have an EmployeeID linked to Workday (threshold: 95%).
- **Uniqueness:** No duplicates in account or group names (detection via SQL DISTINCT).
- **Validity:** High privileges must be justified by an active department (AD-HR cross-check).
- **Timeliness:** Accounts inactive for >90 days (Splunk logs) marked as orphaned.
- **Consistency:** Alignment between AD and Sailpoint for roles (verification via API).
These rules were applied via SQL scripts joining the Workday and AD databases.

### Metrics 

- **Completeness:** 92% (8% of accounts without EmployeeID).
- **Uniqueness:** 98% (2% duplicates detected).
- **Validity:** 85% (15% unjustified rights).
- **Timeliness:** 88% (12% orphaned).
- **Overall consistency:** 90%. Average quality score: 90.6/100. Recommendations: Clean up 120 accounts before onboarding.
