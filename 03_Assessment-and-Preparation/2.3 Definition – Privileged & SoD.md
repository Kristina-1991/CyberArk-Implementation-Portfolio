# Workshops for SoD Application and Account Sorting

## Objective
Define a clean, prioritised list aligned with business risks.

## Approach 
As a BA, I organise workshops with stakeholders to apply the principle of Segregation of Duties (SoD). This principle makes it possible to identify toxic combinations (e.g. an account cannot be both an administrator and an auditor) and to sort accounts to determine which ones to onboard (e.g. prioritise critical ones).
During these workshops, my role is to facilitate the sessions, document decisions (e.g., SoD matrices), and incorporate feedback to refine the inventory.
I collaborate with business stakeholders, application owners, compliance/risk teams to apply SoD, and security teams to validate the implementation of accounts in CyberArk.

## Definition of Privileged account

A privileged account is any account with high access to critical resources, capable of impacting confidentiality, integrity or availability (CIA triad). Examples: AD admins, root on servers, AWS IAM roles with full access, or service accounts with DB rights (Azure SQL). Criteria: Rights > standard user, access to sensitive data (e.g. FinClear trading), or potential for privilege escalation.

## Method to apply Segragation of Duties

I organised workshops to map roles and identify conflicts (e.g. an account cannot approve and execute). Steps:

- List the accounts in the inventory.
- Create a SoD matrix (roles vs. incompatible functions).
- Validate with stakeholders via workshops (2-3 sessions).
- Sort: Onboard compliant accounts, resolve conflicts (e.g. password rotation via CyberArk). Tool: Excel for matrix, integrated with Sailpoint for automation.
