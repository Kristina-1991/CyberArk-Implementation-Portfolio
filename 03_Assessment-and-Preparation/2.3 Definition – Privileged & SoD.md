# Workshops for defining segragation of duties application and acccount sorting

## Objective
Define a clean, prioritised list aligned with business risks.

## Approach 
As a BA, I organise workshops with stakeholders to apply the principle of Segregation of Duties (SoD). This principle makes it possible to identify toxic combinations (e.g. an account cannot be both an administrator and an auditor) and to sort accounts to determine which ones to onboard (e.g. prioritise critical ones).
During these workshops, my role is to facilitate the sessions, document decisions (e.g., SoD matrices), and incorporate feedback to refine the inventory.
I collaborate with business stakeholders, application owners, compliance/risk teams to apply SoD, and security teams to validate the implementation of accounts in CyberArk.

## Definition of Privileged account

A privileged account is any account with high access to critical resources, capable of impacting confidentiality, integrity or availability (CIA triad). Examples: AD admins, root on servers, AWS IAM roles with full access, or service accounts with DB rights (Azure SQL). Criteria: Rights > standard user, access to sensitive data (e.g. FinClear trading), or potential for privilege escalation.

## Method to apply Segragation of Duties

I organised workshops with stakeholders.
Steps:

- List the accounts in the inventory.
- Create a SoD matrix (roles vs. incompatible functions).
- Validate with stakeholders via workshops (2-3 sessions).
- Sort: Onboard compliant accounts, resolve conflicts (e.g. password rotation via CyberArk). Tool: Excel for matrix, integrated with Sailpoint for automation.

## Fictional Segregation of Duties (SoD) Matrix

As an IAM  Business Analyst, I developed this fictional SoD matrix to illustrate potential role-function conflicts during the CyberArk implementation. The matrix helps identify and mitigate risks by ensuring no single role combines incompatible duties (e.g., approving and executing the same action). 

- **Legend**: 
  - **OK**: The role can perform the function without conflict.
  - **Conflict**: The role should not perform this function to maintain SoD (potential risk of fraud or error).

This matrix is based on best practices (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001) and is tailored to the AS-IS architecture (Workday, Sailpoint, Entra ID, AD, Splunk). In real scenarios, it would be validated through workshops with stakeholders.

| Role / Function          | Approve | Execute | Monitor | Audit | Create | Delete | Modify | Access Sensitive Data | Approve Changes |
|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| AD Admin                | OK     | Conflict | OK     | Conflict | OK    | Conflict | OK    | Conflict             | Conflict       |
| Application Owner       | Conflict | OK     | OK     | OK    | Conflict | OK     | OK    | OK                   | OK             |
| Contractor              | OK     | OK     | Conflict | OK    | OK    | Conflict | Conflict | Conflict            | Conflict       |
| Database Admin          | Conflict | OK     | OK     | Conflict | OK    | OK     | OK    | Conflict             | Conflict       |
| Network Admin           | OK     | Conflict | OK     | Conflict | Conflict | OK     | OK    | Conflict             | OK             |
| Compliance Officer      | OK     | Conflict | Conflict | OK    | Conflict | Conflict | Conflict | OK                  | OK             |
| Developer               | Conflict | OK     | Conflict | Conflict | OK    | OK     | OK    | Conflict             | Conflict       |
| End User                | Conflict | OK     | Conflict | Conflict | Conflict | Conflict | Conflict | Conflict            | Conflict       |

**Notes on Application**:
- This matrix was derived from inventory analysis and stakeholder workshops.
- Conflicts are flagged for remediation, such as role splitting or automated controls via CyberArk/Sailpoint.
- Collaborators involved: Compliance/risk teams (for validation), application owners (for role mapping), security admins (for privilege criteria), and business stakeholders (for workshops).

This is a fictional example for portfolio purposes only.
