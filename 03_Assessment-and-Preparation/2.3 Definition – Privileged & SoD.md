# Workshops for SoD Application and Account Sorting

## Objective
Define a clean, prioritised list aligned with business risks.

## Approach 
As a BA, I organise workshops with stakeholders to apply the principle of Segregation of Duties (SoD). This principle makes it possible to identify role conflicts (e.g. an account cannot be both an administrator and an auditor) and to sort accounts to determine which ones to onboard (e.g. prioritise critical ones).
During these workshops, my role is to facilitate the sessions, document decisions (e.g., SoD matrices), and incorporate feedback to refine the inventory.
I collaborate with business stakeholders, application owners, compliance/risk teams to apply SoD, and security teams to validate the implementation of accounts in CyberArk.
