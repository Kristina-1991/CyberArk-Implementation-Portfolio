# Acceptance criteria 

As the IAM Business Analyst, I translate each requirement into clear, observable outcomes that define what “done” means for this use case. Acceptance Criteria are **measurable**, **testable**, and **evidence-based**: they state the expected behavior, the success thresholds (e.g., % coverage, time-boxing, retention), and the artifacts that prove it (logs/exports/screenshots). They align to the BRD, map to UAT test cases, and support audit/compliance (ISO 27001, NIS2, GDPR, DORA). UAT is gated on these AC: each item must be **PASS** with evidence stored in the repository; otherwise the use case remains **NOT DONE**.


## BR-00: Data discovery & reconciliation (Phase 0)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [AC-1] ≥ 95% of privileged accounts for priority systems identified with **owner** assigned.
- [AC-2] **Orphan/shared/stale** patterns reported with baseline metrics and remediation actions.
- [AC-3] **Onboarding Waves v1** approved (systems, owners, dates).

**Evidence:** Inventory CSV, DQ report, Waves plan (signed).

## BR_01: Semi-automated onboarding 

### Acceptance Criteria
- [AC-1] ≥ 90% of Wave-1 privileged accounts appear in **Pending Accounts** after Discovery, with correct owner/metadata.
- [AC-2] Accounts onboarded to the **expected Safe** and **Platform**; **password rotation** policy active (first rotation successful).
- [AC-3] **Separation** enforced: no standard accounts in privileged Safes; service vs human tagged correctly.
- [AC-4] **Job Monitor** shows success and the **Pending Accounts** queue is cleared for Wave-1.

**Evidence:** Pending Accounts export, Job Monitor export, Safe/Platform screenshots, first-rotation log.

## BR-02: Just-in-time workflows

### Acceptance Criteria
- [AC-1] > 90% of privileged sessions are proxied via **PSM** and **recorded** (encrypted).
- [AC-2] Recording **metadata** (user, target, start/stop, request_id) is available in the log sink and retained ≥ 1 year.
- [AC-3] Sample **alert** or query demonstrates we can find a given session by request_id or user.

**Evidence:** PSM recording entry, metadata export (CSV/LOG), retention/config note, sample query result.

## BR-03 : Session recording (PSM + SIEM export)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [AC-1] > 90% of privileged sessions are proxied via **PSM** and **recorded** (encrypted).
- [AC-2] Recording **metadata** (user, target, start/stop, request_id) is available in the log sink and retained ≥ 1 year.
- [AC-3] Sample **alert** or query demonstrates we can find a given session by request_id or user.

**Evidence:** PSM recording entry, metadata export (CSV/LOG), retention/config note, sample query result.
