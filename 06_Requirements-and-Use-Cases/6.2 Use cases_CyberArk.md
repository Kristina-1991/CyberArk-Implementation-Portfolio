# Use Cases

This section translates the BRD into three concrete, testable use cases that implement our Zero Trust objectives across a hybrid, multi-cloud environment. Each use case follows the same structure (Primary Actor, Trigger, Pre-conditions, Primary Flow, Alternate/Exception Flows, Post-conditions) so both business and technical readers can follow the logic and verify outcomes with evidence.




## UC-1: Semi-automated onboarding (with Discovery verification)

This use-case describe how a privileged accounts is onboarded securely in CyberArk. A PAM administrator receives a new privileged account request from HR/IGA (for executives, cloud, or IoT identities).
Before starting, an onboarding policy is already defined that identifies what a privileged account is and enforces separation from standard accounts. The target accounts already exist in AD or on the target systems (multi-cloud: AWS/Azure/GCP, IoT) and belong to critical applications/servers. Onboarding rules, platforms, and Safes are configured. A Discovery Scan has been run and produced Pending Accounts. The PAM admin performs a quick verification against rights, Safe, Platform, and Master Policy expectations.

The semi-automated process in PVWA proceeds as follows:

1. Navigate to Accounts → Pending Accounts to view Discovery results (candidate privileged accounts).

2. Select the accounts (bulk selection). PVWA highlights eligible items and enables Onboard.

3. Click Onboard and confirm/define key parameters: Safe, Platform, and password rotation as required by policy.

4. PVWA pre-fills fields from rules and launches onboarding.

5. Track progress in Job Monitor until “Onboarding completed”; accounts are moved to their Safes.

**Post-condition:** privileged accounts are onboarded into CyberArk Safes and ready for secure actions through PSM. The setup enforces Zero Trust (continuous verification, least privilege) and the AAA model (Authentication via IDP, Authorization via Master Policy, Accounting via audits), supports ISO 27001 / NIS2 / GDPR / DORA alignment, reduces onboarding errors (~20%), cuts processing time (~70%), and helps eliminate unmanaged accounts (e.g., 150 identified in 2024).
