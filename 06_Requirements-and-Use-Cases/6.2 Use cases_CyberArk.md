# Use Cases

This section translates the BRD into three concrete, testable use cases that implement our Zero Trust objectives across a hybrid, multi-cloud environment. Each use case follows the same structure (Primary Actor, Trigger, Pre-conditions, Primary Flow, Alternate/Exception Flows, Post-conditions) so both business and technical readers can follow the logic and verify outcomes with evidence.


## UC-1: Semi-automated onboarding (with Discovery verification)

This use case describes how privileged accounts (executives, cloud, IoT) are **bulk-onboarded** into CyberArk following a **Discovery scan**, with a verification step by the PAM Administrator to ensure proper **Safe**, **Platform**, and **Master Policy** alignment before activation. The approach reduces **errors (−20%)** and **processing time (−70%)**, reinforces **Zero Trust** and the **AAA** model (Authentication via IdP, Authorization via policy/workflow, Accounting via audits), and supports compliance with **ISO 27001, NIS2, GDPR, and DORA**. Once verified, accounts are onboarded to Safes and become available for secure actions through **PSM**.

## UC-2: Just-in-time (JIT) approval workflow

This use case illustrates the Just-in-Time (JIT) access request and dual-approval process for privileged sessions on critical systems (servers, cloud, IoT) managed through CyberArk PVWA and PSM.  
It demonstrates how temporary privileged access can be securely provisioned and revoked while maintaining continuous control and auditability.

The workflow enforces **Zero Trust** and **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)** principles by requiring users to submit access requests that are verified through **dual control** and approved within a strict time window (30 minutes). Once approved, access is granted dynamically via PVWA, and the session is initiated and recorded through PSM.

From a business perspective, this process:
- **Reduces data leaks (by 25%)** and **operational outages (by 10 cases in 2024)** by limiting standing privileges.
- Ensures compliance with **ISO 27001, NIS2, GDPR, and DORA** through traceable, policy-based access.
- Reinforces **segregation of duties**, with clear roles for End-Users, Approvers, and PAM Administrators.

**Key outcome:** JIT access is granted only when justified and approved, monitored in real-time, and automatically revoked — providing a measurable gain in both **security and operational efficiency**.

## UC-3: Privileged accounts session recording

This use case focuses on the recording and monitoring of privileged sessions for critical systems (servers, cloud, IoT) via the CyberArk PSM.  
It ensures full visibility over privileged activity to prevent fraud and maintain compliance with key regulatory frameworks.

The system enables **encrypted session recording**, real-time **anomaly detection via SIEM**, and **retention of session logs for one year** in compliance with GDPR.  
If an anomaly is detected, a **manual review** is triggered for forensic analysis.  
In case of a technical failure, an alert is automatically generated and investigated by the PAM Administrator.

From a business and governance perspective, this use case:
- **Prevents fraud and unauthorized changes** (estimated loss prevention: €500,000).  
- Reinforces **Zero Trust** and **AAA** models through universal monitoring and continuous verification.  
- Guarantees **auditability and accountability** aligned with **ISO 27001, NIS2, GDPR, and DORA** standards.

**Key outcome:** Every privileged session is securely recorded, analyzed, and retained — ensuring that high-risk operations are traceable, reportable, and compliant with enterprise and regulatory requirements.
