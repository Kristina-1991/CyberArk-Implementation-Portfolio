## BPMN Diagrams - AS-IS & TO-BE
Based on interviews with key stakeholders, the following BPMN diagrams illustrate the AS-IS and TO-BE states for the three key use cases in the CyberArk implementation. The AS-IS diagrams highlight pain points and the resulting operational and compliance issues. The TO-BE diagrams presented and validated during dedicated workshops with business, executive, security, compliance, HR/IGA, and Cloud/IoT stakeholders outline the future objectives under a Zero Trust model (continuous verification, least-privilege enforcement, enterprise-wide monitoring). CyberArk’s expected benefits include increased automation, measurable risk reduction (e.g., ~20% onboarding errors, €500,000 fraud exposure), and support for compliance alignment with ISO 27001, NIS2, GDPR, and DORA, while remaining compatible with a hybrid, multi-cloud environment and growing IoT usage.
## 1. Manual onboarding of privileged accounts - AS IS
This BPMN for manual onboarding highlights pain points such as lack of standardization and insecure credential storage, leading to operational inefficiencies (e.g., 20% error rate, delays in deployments) and compliance issues (e.g., untraceable accounts violating RGPD data protection and NIS2 resilience requirements, resulting in €250,000 fines).

## 2. Login to critical resources without approval from a member of the Security team - AS IS
This BPMN diagram describes how an end-user currently authenticates to a critical application. Access is requested and processed directly by the target system: the user enters credentials, the application validates them, and access is granted or denied. There is no self-service request or approval workflow, no just-in-time elevation, and only basic controls (e.g., a “max 3 failed logins” policy). Because the flow bypasses centralized IAM/PAM governance, it provides limited auditability and no consistent enforcement of least privilege. In practice, this exposes the organization to excessive-privilege risks, weak segregation of duties, and incomplete evidence for compliance reviews.

What the diagram highlights: direct login path, simple credential check, failed-login loop, and the absence of approval/monitoring touchpoints that would normally exist in a Zero Trust model (request → verify → approve → record).

## 3. Log basic - AS IS
This BPMN shows how a Windows administrator conducts a privileged session directly on a critical system. After initiating a direct login, the admin performs high-impact actions (config changes, database extracts) with no proxy, no just-in-time elevation, and no session recording. Only basic logs are written to the SIEM, which means there is no real-time monitoring, no analytics/alerting, and limited evidence for investigations or audits. The result is a high exposure to fraud, data leakage, and misconfiguration risks, with clear non-alignment to Zero Trust and regulatory expectations (NIS2/GDPR/ISO 27001) due to insufficient traceability and accountability.

What the diagram highlights: direct access to the privileged account, execution of critical actions, minimal log capture, and an unmonitored session end-precisely the gaps that the TO-BE design will close with CyberArk PSM (proxy + recording), analytics, and SIEM integrations.

## 4. Semi-automated onboarding with verification after Discovery scan  - TO BE 
This BPMN describes the target onboarding flow for privileged accounts. Identities originate in the HRIS (source of truth) and are governed by IGA policies; entitlements are derived from roles and risk. CyberArk consumes these events to discover, classify, and onboard privileged accounts with enforced separation between standard and privileged identities. Quality checks and real-time synchronization (SCIM/LDAP/API) keep attributes accurate across Entra/AD → PAM → SIEM. Approvals for sensitive entitlements are routed to the right owners, while orphan/shared accounts are flagged and remediated. The outcome is a faster, safer onboarding process aligned with Zero Trust—least privilege from day one and auditable evidence by design.

## 5. Just-in-time workflow for privileged accounts - TO BE 
This BPMN shows how privileged access is requested, verified, and granted just-in-time. The user submits a request via PVWA; the IDP (SAML/OIDC) authenticates the user and supplies context (MFA, device, risk). The request is evaluated against policy and SoD rules; dual control provides independent approval for high-risk actions. Once approved, CyberArk provisions a time-bounded, scope-limited entitlement and logs every step. If the request is rejected, the user is notified and no elevation occurs. This pattern enforces least privilege, creates a complete audit trail, and supports compliance alignment with ISO 27001 / NIS2 / DORA / GDPR.

## 6. Session recording for privileged accounts - TO BE 
This BPMN depicts the controlled execution of privileged sessions through CyberArk PSM. After successful JIT or policy-based authorization, the user connects via a secure proxy; credentials are vaulted and never exposed. The entire session is recorded and encrypted, with metadata (who/when/what/system) streamed to the SIEM for monitoring, alerting, and investigations. If anomalous activity is detected, security teams can alert/escalate and revoke access. At session close, recordings and logs are retained per policy to provide reliable evidence for audits and forensics. This achieves Zero Trust operationally: continuous verification, monitored execution, and provable accountability.
