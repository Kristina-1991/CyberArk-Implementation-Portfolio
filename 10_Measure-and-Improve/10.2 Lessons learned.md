## Lessons learned

From the CyberArk implementation, key lessons include the importance of early data quality checks during synchronization to avoid onboarding errors (20% reduction post-sync setup) and integrating self-service PVWA with IGA for faster approvals (25% leak reduction projection). Incident alerting via SIEM proved critical for escalade, preventing potential fraud (â‚¬500,000 saved), while multi-cloud/IoT onboarding required additional API testing for SCIM/LDAP. Overall, Zero Trust enhanced resilience, but future projects should prioritize analytics dashboards for real-time KPIs.
