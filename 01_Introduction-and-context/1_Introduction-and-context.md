# 1.1 Introduction & Context

## Case Study
This scenario is based on a fictional company.

**FinClear** is a financial market infrastructure provider operating as a central securities depository and a post-trade services provider (settlement/delivery, custody, collateral, and fund services). The organisation has ~4,000 employees across 21 offices worldwide.

To strengthen its security posture, FinClear has decided to modernise its IT operating model and establish a **CISO function**. Following an internal audit, the CIO mandated an enhancement of the **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** security architecture, with a specific focus on **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** and governance.

A team of external consultants from an international firm was engaged, including an **IAM/PAM Business Analyst**. This case study focuses on the BA’s responsibilities and deliverables across the engagement.

## Drivers & Scope
- **Security model:** Implement a **Zero Trust** approach (continuous verification, least privilege).
- **Coverage:** Hybrid / **multi-cloud** landscape (Azure/AWS/GCP) and critical on-prem systems.
- **Integrations:** IGA/Directory/IDP/PAM/SIEM with standard **protocols** (OAuth2/OIDC, **SAML**, **SCIM**, **LDAP/LDAPS**, REST APIs).
- **Compliance:** Align with **ISO/IEC 27001**, **NIS2**, **DORA**, and **GDPR** (evidence-based).

## Objectives (Business Analyst)
- **Support scope definition** with the Project Lead by clarifying objectives, constraints, and success metrics in the IAM domain.  
- **Elicit and structure requirements** into a comprehensive, testable work product (BRD, backlog, models).  
- **Define clear acceptance criteria** that can serve as a complete **UAT** test set (evidence-by-design).  
- **Analyse multiple information sources** (interviews, audits, architecture) to define scope and approach.  
- **Collaborate with key stakeholders** and technical teams to determine the approach for **privileged-account onboarding** into IAM/PAM platforms.  
- **Co-lead analysis and onboarding activities** with the Project Lead, ensuring traceability **Requirement → Control → Evidence → KPI**.

> _Note_: This is a fictional case study designed to demonstrate the BA role and deliverables in an IAM/PAM context. Any resemblance to real organisations is coincidental.
