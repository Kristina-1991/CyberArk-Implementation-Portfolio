## Protocol & Integration Matrix 

The **Protocol & Integration Matrix** provides a clear, traceable view of **who communicates with whom, and how** within the PAM ecosystem.

Its purpose is twofold:  
1) To **highlight critical connections** between CyberArk and third-party systems (AD/LDAP, IGA, SIEM, ITSM, Cloud, etc.), and  
2) To **demonstrate the security and compliance controls** (encryption, authentication, monitoring) that support both Go-Live readiness and BAU operations.

#### What is the purpose of this matrix?
- **For business / non-technical audiences:** it shows that every exchange of sensitive information (e.g., access requests, session recordings) is **secure, traceable, and justified**, in alignment with BRD objectives, **KPI targets**, and **compliance frameworks** such as ISO 27001, NIS2, DORA, and GDPR.  
- **For technical audiences:** it captures, for each integration, the **key parameters** required for design, testing (UAT), monitoring, and support — including protocols, ports, authentication, encryption, flow direction, and log visibility.

#### How to read a line in the table?
> **Each line = one integration** (for example, *CyberArk ↔ Active Directory*).  
> The columns describe:  
> - **Integration Type** – the nature of the connection (directory sync, API, logging, etc.)  
> - **Protocol / Port** – the “language” and “channel” used for communication  
> - **Authentication & Encryption** – how systems identify and protect themselves  
> - **Direction** – inbound / outbound / bidirectional  
> - **Monitoring** – where the logs and alerts are collected  
> - **Comments** – the business purpose of the integration (e.g., account discovery, password rotation, audit recording)

#### Why is this important in the project?
- **Governance & Compliance:** provides a clear mapping of sensitive data flows and associated controls.  
- **Quality & Testing:** acts as a reference for preparing **UAT scenarios (TU01–TU12)** and validating successful integrations.  
- **Operations:** supports faster **incident troubleshooting** (knowing which system, protocol, or port is involved) and smoother **change management** (e.g., API updates or certificate renewals).

> In short, this matrix bridges **business meaning** (why data is exchanged) with **technical execution** (how it is exchanged securely), ensuring a shared understanding across business stakeholders, auditors, and technical teams throughout the PAM lifecycle.
