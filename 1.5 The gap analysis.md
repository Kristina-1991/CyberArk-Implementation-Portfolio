### The gap Analysis
___

The gap analysis contrasts today’s practices with the Zero Trust target, highlighting where onboarding, approvals, monitoring, compliance, data quality, and integrations fall short and which concrete CyberArk-centric mitigations will close each gap.

| Aspect | AS-IS (IT-delegated) | TO-BE (Zero Trust) | Gap | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Onboarding | Manual; ~20% assignment errors | Semi-automated; supports IoT & multi-cloud | No discovery; no separation of standard vs. privileged accounts | **CyberArk Discovery** + **IGA** integration; enforce account separation |
| Approval | E-mail-based approvals | **JIT** workflows with continuous verification | No formal process / audit trail | **PVWA** workflows; **SAML/OIDC** integration; dual control |
| Recording | None | AI-assisted analysis; coverage across multi-cloud & IoT | No universal monitoring | **PSM** session recording; **PTA/UEBA**; **SIEM** export |
| Compliance | €250,000 fine (GDPR/NIS2/ISO 27001) | Aligned with **ISO 27001 / NIS2 / GDPR / DORA** | Missing audits & evidence | Centralised audit reports; 1-year (min) retention; mapped controls/evidence |
| Data quality / Synchronization | Manual updates; poor integrity | Real-time sync (events/batches) via APIs | No **SCIM/API** provisioning | **SCIM/LDAP** integration (HRIS → IGA → Entra/AD → CyberArk); data validation rules |
| Self-service | No delegated admin | IAM portal with request/approval workflows | No approval logic | **PVWA** self-request; policy-based approvals; SoD/dual control |
| Integration | Limited ecosystem | Standardised **API / Entra-AD / HRIS / SIEM** flows | Gaps with incident/ops tools | Hardened connectors; runbooks; health checks; SIEM dashboards |
| Incident / Risk | No proactive alerting | Escalations, alerts, risk scoring | No defined incident process | **PSM/SIEM** alerts; on-call/escalation matrix; playbooks |
| Analytics / KPIs | No reporting | Dashboards: % onboarded, % audited sessions, orphan <5%, de-prov <24h | No KPIs or ownership | **PTA/Analytics** + SIEM queries; owners & review cadence |
