# CyberArk-Implementation-Portfolio
This repository presents a complete **CyberArk implementation scenario** developed as part of an IAM/PAM governance portfolio.   The project demonstrates how to **secure privileged accounts**, ensure **regulatory compliance** (ISO 27001, NIS2, DORA, GDPR), and implement a **Zero Trust architecture** across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
