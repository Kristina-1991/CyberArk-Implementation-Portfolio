Fields expected:
- timestamp (ISO8601), product=PAM, event=(session_start|approval_granted|session_end)
- user, target, method (PSM), request_id, approver (if approval), policy, duration, status

In production:
- In Splunk/Elastic, we would create a field extraction (e.g., "pam_session_*")
- A saved search would filter session_start/session_end and join by request_id
- Dashboard: sessions over time, failed vs success, top targets/users
