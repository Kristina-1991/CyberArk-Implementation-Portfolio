# Deployment & support scénario 

The objective is to demonstrate the CyberArk implementation phases:  pre-production, production and hypercare ensuring Zero-trust, multi-cloud/IoT support, and ISO27001/NIS2/RGPD/DORA compliance.

## Pre-Production environment (Pre-Prod phase)

**Main objective:** Validate configurations, integrations and workflows in controlled environment. 
**Scope:** Migrate configurations from DEV to PRE-PROD, validate Vault/CPM/PVWA/PSM, test connectivity (AD/IGA/ID/SIEM), and self-service for IoT/cloud accounts.

**Activities** 

| Step | Description                                                                                                                       | Responsible            | Deliverable               |
|-----:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1    | Deploy configuration package (Vault policies, Safes, Platforms, JIT Workflows).                                                   | PAM Administrator      | Pre-prod checklist        |
| 2    | Re-run UAT tests (TU01–TU12) with IoT/cloud accounts, verify data sync (IGA/AD).                                                  | QA / Security Team     | Validation report         |
| 3    | Validate integrations with (AD/IGA via SCIM/LDAP, SIEM logs, PVWA self-service) with alerting for failures.                       | IAM Engineer           | Integration report        |
| 4    | Approve Go/No-Go criteria (based on Definition of Done + KPIs).                                                                   | Project Manager / CISO | Go/No-Go decision form    |

**Exit Criteria:** 100% UAT passed (TU01–TU12), no critical/high defects, security sign-off obtained, KPIs validated. 

## Production Deployement (Go-Live Phase)

**Main Objective:**  Activate the solution in the production, onboard critical accounts, ensure user readiness.
**Scope:** Deploy validated configurations, onboard IoT/cloud accounts, test self-service workflows, monitor SIEM integration.

| 5    | Communicate Go-Live, provide PVWA user guide.                                                                                     | Change Manager         | Email & user guide        |


**Exit Criteria:** Pilot onboarding successful, logs exported to SIEM, no major incidents, certification >90% achieved.
