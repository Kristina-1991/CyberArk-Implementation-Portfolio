## Hypercare Phase (Post-Go-Live support)

**Main objective:** Ensure operational stability, user adoption and continuous improvement post go-live. 

**Duration:** 2 to 4 weeks

**Scope:** Monitor IoT/cloud sessions, collect PVWA self-service feedback, track KPIs. 

**Activities**

| Step | Description                                                                                                                       | Responsible              | Deliverable             |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1    | Monitor onboarding, password rotations, IoT/cloud sessions via API/SIEM, track KPIs (% audited >90%).                             | PAM Administrator        | Daily Hypercare report  |
| 2    | Collect user feedback on PVWA self-service, resolve issues via support tickets.                                                   | Service Desk / IAM Support | Feedback / issue log    |
| 3    | Handover to BAU with KPI dashboard and stability review.                                    | Service Manager           | Handover report         |

**Exit Criteria:** All user feedback addressed or planned, system stability confirmed for 2 consecutive weeks., ownership transferred to IAM team, compliant with ISO27001/NIS2/RGPD/DORA.

## Change management 

The Change Management strategy for the CyberArk implementation ensures smooth adoption across FinClear, minimizing resistance and maximizing Zero Trust benefits. It focuses on communication, training, and support, integrating data quality synchronization, self-service via PVWA, API/SCIM/LDAP integrations with IGA/AD/IDP/SIEM, incident alerting/escalade, and analytics/KPIs. The strategy follows ADKAR model (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement), with SLA for 99.9% uptime on multi-cloud/IoT sync.

### Key activities 

- **Communication:** Announce go-live via emails and portal, highlighting Zero Trust security and RGPD compliance.
- **Training:** Sessions for self-service PVWA requests, data sync guidelines, and incident escalation (2 days, 100% end-users trained).
- **Support:** Hypercare helpdesk for issues, SLA for API integrations (response <2h for critical incidents).
- **Guidelines:** Documented policies for data quality (integrity checks during sync), self-service workflows, and KPI monitoring.

### Change management Plan 

This strategy reduces (e.g.,20% onboarding errors) and ensures NIS2/DORA compliance through proactive adoption.
