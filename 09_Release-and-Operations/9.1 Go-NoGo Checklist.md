# Go/No-Go Checklist – CyberArk Implementation

Before authorizing production cutover, this Go/No-Go checklist consolidates functional, security, and operational readiness for the CyberArk rollout. Each criterion has a clear target, evidence source, accountable owner, and an explicit status. The decision gate requires all Must-Have items to be ✅ or documented with an approved risk acceptance. Should-Have items can be ⚠️ only if a short-dated remediation plan is attached. The final decision is recorded by the Project Manager and CISO.
