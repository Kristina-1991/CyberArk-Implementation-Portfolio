# 8.1 UAT Plan 

**Purpose**: Validate that Acceptance Criteria (AC) for BR-01/02/03 are met with observable evidence.

**Scope**: BR-01 Semi-automated onboarding · BR-02 JIT approval workflow · BR-03 Session recording.

**Traceability**: UAT scenarios map to ACs defined per use case (see: `06_Requirements-and-Use-Cases/1.7 Use cases_CyberArk.md`).

## Approach 

As the IAM Business Analyst, I designed this UAT to verify that each use case (BR-01/02/03) meets its Acceptance Criteria with observable, auditable evidence. UAT execution is gated by the Environment Readiness Checks; once those are PASS, we run focused scenarios that trace directly to ACs and capture one artifact per result (log/export/screenshot or tool-agnostic file). I coordinate stakeholders (PAM Engineering, Security Operations, Identity/IGA-IDP, Infra) and track outcomes, defects, and re-tests until every AC is PASS.

Scope. BR-01 (Semi-automated onboarding), BR-02 (JIT approval workflow), BR-03 (Session recording).

Traceability. Each test case maps to specific Acceptance Criteria per use case.

Evidence. One artifact per test (stored in the Evidence Pack) to support audit/compliance (ISO 27001, NIS2, GDPR, DORA).

Gating. UAT starts only after Environment Readiness = PASS; release depends on all ACs = PASS.

Defects. Any FAIL is logged with owner/severity; re-test is required before Go/No-Go.

## BR-01 — Semi-automated onboarding

**Scenario UAT-01.** Discovery → Pending Accounts → Onboard (Wave-1)
- **Pre-conditions:** Discovery scheduled; candidate accounts visible in Pending.
- **Steps:** run Discovery (or use sample) → verify metadata (owner, platform) → onboard to Safe/Platform → verify first rotation.
- **Expected:** accounts appear in Pending; onboarded to correct Safe/Platform; rotation OK; Pending cleared.
- **AC covered:** BR-01 [AC-1], [AC-2], [AC-4]
- **Evidence:** Pending export, Job Monitor export, Safe/Platform screenshots → `99_Support-documents/evidence/`

## BR-02 — JIT approval workflow

**Scenario UAT-02.** Request → Dual approval → Time-boxed elevation
- **Pre-conditions:** PVWA SSO working; policy/SoD rules configured.
- **Steps:** submit request in PVWA → approver A approves → approver B approves → elevation auto-expires.
- **Expected:** no email approvals; dual approval enforced; auto-revocation at expiry; full audit trail.
- **AC covered:** BR-02 [AC-1], [AC-2], [AC-3]
- **Evidence:** PVWA request/approval logs, policy screenshot, auto-revocation log → `99_Support-documents/evidence/`

## BR-03 — Session recording

**Scenario UAT-03.** PSM proxied session + metadata in log sink
- **Pre-conditions:** PSM path configured; log export path defined (tool-agnostic).
- **Steps:** launch privileged session via PSM → end session → check recording entry and metadata file.
- **Expected:** >90% sessions go through PSM and are recorded; metadata (user, target, start/stop, request_id) available; retention noted.
- **AC covered:** BR-03 [AC-1], [AC-2], [AC-3]
- **Evidence:** recording entry (screenshot or MD note), metadata CSV/LOG, retention/config note → `99_Support-documents/evidence/`
