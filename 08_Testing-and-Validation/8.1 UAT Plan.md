# 8.1 UAT Plan 







**Purpose**: Validate that Acceptance Criteria (AC) for BR-01/02/03 are met with observable evidence.

**Scope**: BR-01 Semi-automated onboarding · BR-02 JIT approval workflow · BR-03 Session recording.

**Traceability**: UAT scenarios map to ACs defined per use case (see: `06_Requirements-and-Use-Cases/1.7 Use cases_CyberArk.md`).

---

## BR-01 — Semi-automated onboarding

**Scenario UAT-01.** Discovery → Pending Accounts → Onboard (Wave-1)
- **Pre-conditions:** Discovery scheduled; candidate accounts visible in Pending.
- **Steps:** run Discovery (or use sample) → verify metadata (owner, platform) → onboard to Safe/Platform → verify first rotation.
- **Expected:** accounts appear in Pending; onboarded to correct Safe/Platform; rotation OK; Pending cleared.
- **AC covered:** BR-01 [AC-1], [AC-2], [AC-4]
- **Evidence:** Pending export, Job Monitor export, Safe/Platform screenshots → `99_Support-documents/evidence/`

## BR-02 — JIT approval workflow

**Scenario UAT-02.** Request → Dual approval → Time-boxed elevation
- **Pre-conditions:** PVWA SSO working; policy/SoD rules configured.
- **Steps:** submit request in PVWA → approver A approves → approver B approves → elevation auto-expires.
- **Expected:** no email approvals; dual approval enforced; auto-revocation at expiry; full audit trail.
- **AC covered:** BR-02 [AC-1], [AC-2], [AC-3]
- **Evidence:** PVWA request/approval logs, policy screenshot, auto-revocation log → `99_Support-documents/evidence/`

---

## BR-03 — Session recording

**Scenario UAT-03.** PSM proxied session + metadata in log sink
- **Pre-conditions:** PSM path configured; log export path defined (tool-agnostic).
- **Steps:** launch privileged session via PSM → end session → check recording entry and metadata file.
- **Expected:** >90% sessions go through PSM and are recorded; metadata (user, target, start/stop, request_id) available; retention noted.
- **AC covered:** BR-03 [AC-1], [AC-2], [AC-3]
- **Evidence:** recording entry (screenshot or MD note), metadata CSV/LOG, retention/config note → `99_Support-documents/evidence/`
