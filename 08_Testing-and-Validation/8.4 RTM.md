## Requirement Traceability Matrix 

The **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** provides end-to-end visibility between business requirements, functional specifications, and validation outcomes.  
From a Business Analyst perspective, it ensures that every requirement defined in the BRD is properly implemented, tested, and aligned with compliance and risk objectives.

In the context of the **CyberArk PAM implementation**, the RTM links:
- **Business requirements** (risk reduction, auditability, Zero Trust alignment),  
- to **functional components** (IGA sync, password rotation, PSM recording, approval workflows),  
- and to **UAT test cases (TU01â€“TU12)** confirming successful validation.

This document serves as a single source of truth for stakeholders, enabling transparent tracking of project coverage, identifying potential gaps, and supporting **Go-Live decision-making** with traceable evidence.
