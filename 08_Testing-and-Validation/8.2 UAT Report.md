### Introduction – UAT Report 

This report summarizes the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) outcomes for the CyberArk PAM implementation.  
The goal was to validate that the solution meets the business and compliance requirements defined in the BRD under near-production conditions (pre-prod) with active IGA/AD, SIEM, and ITSM integrations.  
The 12 scenarios TU01–TU12 cover account discovery and onboarding, approval workflows, session recording (PSM), and reporting.  
All acceptance criteria (≥ 95% pass rate, zero Sev-1 defects) were met; test evidence (screenshots, logs, reports) is referenced to support the Go-Live decision and hypercare readiness.
