### BA Perspective – UAT Session (TU01–TU12)

From a Business Analyst standpoint, the UAT phase represented a critical validation step in confirming the operational readiness and business value of the CyberArk PAM implementation.  
The tests TU01–TU12 were designed to replicate real business scenarios, covering the complete privileged access lifecycle, from discovery and onboarding to session recording and compliance reporting.

Each test case aligned with specific business requirements defined in the BRD and acceptance criteria (Definition of Done).  
This ensured that both functional and compliance objectives were met across multiple domains:

- **Access Control & Governance:** Discovery, onboarding, and orphan account cleanup validated synchronization with IGA and AD.  
- **Operational Security:** Dual-control approval workflows and password rotation mechanisms were verified for traceability and automation.  
- **Monitoring & Compliance:** PSM session recording, SIEM log correlation, and automated reporting demonstrated audit-readiness against ISO 27001, NIS2, DORA, and GDPR controls.  
- **User Experience:** PVWA self-service and approval notifications were tested with business users to confirm usability and response time.

All test scenarios passed successfully (“As expected”), confirming that the PAM platform operates as intended in a controlled pre-production environment.  
From a BA perspective, this phase provided measurable evidence that the implemented solution supports the organization’s **Zero Trust and regulatory compliance goals**, while being operationally sustainable for transition to BAU (Business-as-Usual).
