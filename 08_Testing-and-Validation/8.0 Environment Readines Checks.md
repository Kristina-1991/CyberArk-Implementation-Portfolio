## Environment Readiness Checks (Entry Criteria)

## Purpose
Verify the pre-requisites & integrations before executing UAT for BR-01/02/03

### **IAM Business Analyst perspective** 

As the IAM Business Analyst, I defined together with PAM Engineering, Security Operations (SIEM), Identity (IGA/IDP), and Infrastructure teams. The tool-agnostic Environment Readiness Checks below. They verify that the platform and integrations are operational before we execute UAT for **BR-01/02/03**. Each check maps to a BRD v1 assumption and must produce one evidence artifact (CSV/LOG/JSON/MD) stored under `99_Support-documents/evidence/`. In a production setting, the same controls would be evidenced by screenshots/exports from enterprise tools.

In this portfolio the artifacts are simulated but realistic. I will track the results and gate UAT: all items must be PASS.
Any FAIL pauses testing until the dependency is resolved or an approved workaround is in place. Outcomes are referenced in BRD v1 and in the Go/No-Go checklist.
