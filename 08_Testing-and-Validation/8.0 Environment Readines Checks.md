## Environment Readiness Checks (Entry Criteria)

### Objective: verify the pre-requisites & integrations before executing UAT for BR-01/02/03

### **Purpose** 

As the IAM Business Analyst, I defined together with PAM Engineering, Security Operations (SIEM), Identity (IGA/IDP), and Infrastructure teams the environment readiness checks below. They verify that platform and integrations are operational **before** we execute UAT for BR-01/02/03. 
Each check maps to a BRD assumption and must produce a single piece of evidence (screenshot, log, or export). I will track the results and gate UAT: all items must be **PASS**.
Any **FAIL** pauses testing until the dependency is resolved or an approved workaround is in place. These outcomes are referenced in the **BRD v1** and the **Go/No-Go** checklist.


# 8.0 Environment Readiness Checks (Entry Criteria)

**BA note.** As the IAM Business Analyst, I defined these **tool-agnostic** readiness checks with PAM/IGA/IDP/Infra teams. Each item must produce **one evidence file** (CSV/LOG/JSON) stored under `99_Support-documents/evidence/`. In production, these would be screenshots/exports from enterprise tools. In this portfolio they are **simulated but realistic**.

| ID | Check | Steps | Expected | Evidence (demo) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC-ENV-001 | IDP SAML/OIDC to PVWA | Describe SSO flow and claim mapping in 3–4 lines | Mapping documented | `evidence/TC-ENV-001_SSO-claims.txt` (mapping table) |
| TC-ENV-002 | Network ports for PSM/CPM | List required ports/protocols per target | Port matrix complete | `evidence/TC-ENV-002_Port-Matrix.csv` |
| TC-ENV-003 | Log ingestion pipeline | Provide a **sample PAM log** line + parsing spec (fields/timestamp) | Fields parsable | `evidence/TC-ENV-003_PAM-log-sample.log` + `..._parsing-notes.txt` |
| TC-ENV-004 | Vault backup/retention | Describe backup schedule & retention policy | Policy stated | `evidence/TC-ENV-004_Backup-Policy.txt` |
| TC-ENV-005 | Time sync (NTP) | Provide timestamps from 3 systems (PAM/IDP/log sink) | Skew ≤ policy | `evidence/TC-ENV-005_Time-Check.csv` |
| TC-ENV-006 | IGA → Dir/PAM feeds | Show a **delta file** (before/after) or JSON payload example | Delta reflects change | `evidence/TC-ENV-006_Delta-Example.json` |
| TC-ENV-007 | Connector availability | List target types and matching connectors | Connector listed | `evidence/TC-ENV-007_Connector-Matrix.csv` |
| TC-ENV-008 | Evidence repository | Provide the evidence folder tree (this repo path) | Location accessible | `evidence/TC-ENV-008_Evidence-Index.md` |
