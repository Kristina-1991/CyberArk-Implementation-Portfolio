## RACI matrix 

### Approach

As an IAM Business Analyst, I developed this RACI matrix as part of the stakeholder management process during the CyberArk implementation project. The matrix was created by first mapping out all key stakeholders based on their role descriptions and involvement in specific use cases (e.g., Onboarding, Recording, Approval, and Audit), as outlined in the initial stakeholder table. I derived the RACI assignments Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) through a systematic analysis of each stakeholder's responsibilities, drawing from best practices like those from PMI and COBIT frameworks. This involved cross-referencing role descriptions with project requirements, followed by validation through collaborative workshops with representatives from business, security, compliance, and executive teams to refine and confirm the allocations.

The primary objective of this RACI matrix is to clearly delineate roles and responsibilities across the project's key use cases, ensuring that every task has an owner (Accountable), executor (Responsible), advisors (Consulted), and informed parties (Informed). This promotes efficient decision-making, minimizes overlaps or gaps in accountability, and aligns stakeholder expectations with the project's goals, such as secure privileged access management and compliance with standards like GDPR, NIS2, and ISO 27001.

This matrix is indispensable in the project because it mitigates risks associated with miscommunication or role ambiguity in a complex IAM initiative involving multiple departments and technologies (e.g., Workday, Sailpoint, Entra ID, AD, Splunk). By providing a visual and structured overview, it facilitates smoother collaboration, enhances governance, and contributes to the overall success of the CyberArk rollout by ensuring timely execution and stakeholder buy-in. In a real-world scenario, it would be iteratively updated as the project evolves.

RACI Definitions:

- R (Responsible): Performs the task or activity.
- A (Accountable): Ultimately answerable for the task's completion and quality.
- C (Consulted): Provides input or expertise before the task is completed.
- I (Informed): Kept up-to-date on progress or outcomes, but not involved in execution.

Notes: This is a fictional RACI matrix for portfolio purposes, derived from the stakeholder mapping provided.
Assignments reflect role descriptions and use case involvements (e.g., PAM Admin is Responsible across all due to operational configuration).
In a real project, this matrix would be iteratively refined through stakeholder workshops.
