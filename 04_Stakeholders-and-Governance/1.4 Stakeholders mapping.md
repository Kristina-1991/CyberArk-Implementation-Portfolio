## Stakeholder Mapping : approach
___

As a Business Analyst, I constructed the stakeholder mapping through a systematic process: 

1.	**The preparation** 

I reviewed the business requirements document, audit reports (e.g.,150  unmanaged accounts in 2024) and ecosystem ((Workday, SailPoint, AD, Azure AD, Splunk) to identify initial roles impacted by problems like onboarding inefficiencies and compliance violations.

2.	**Brainstorming** 

I listed stakeholder using a RACI matrix, for example:
    - **Responsible:** PAM admins for configuration
    - **Accountable:** C-level for approval
    - **Consulted:** Compliance for NIS2/GDPR 
    - **Informed:** End-users
    
4.	**Interviews** 

I conducted preliminary interviews with the sponsor (Business Line Director) to gather insights on roles like IoT Managers for non-human identities and Cloud Architects for multi-cloud integrations.

5. **Analysis & prioritization** 

I analyzed influence/impact using a Power/Interest grid(high power/high interest: C-level, PAM Admins; low/low: PAM Support), incorporating criteria like Zero Trust involvement and conformit√©s (e.g., Legal for RGPD).

6.	**Valdiation** 

I iterated the mappingbased on initial feedback to ensure completeness, focusing on self-service (PVWA for end-users) and incident management (SOC for alerting). 
This approach ensured all stakeholders were identified for the CyberArk implementation, supporting Zero trust, multi-cloud/IoT, and ISO27001,NIS2,GDPR and DORA compliance. 

## Stakeholders mapping : table

Based on a preliminary review of existing roles, systems, and incident reports, the stakeholders below are critical to the CyberArk Privileged Access Management implementation.
To align with the Zero Trust model, these functions will be involved in continuous verification, least-privilege enforcement, and enterprise-wide monitoring.
The list covers the main business, executive, security, compliance, and identity governance functions impacted by the proposed use cases.

| Stakeholder | Role Description | Use Case Involvement |
|---|---|---|
| **Business Stakeholders** |  |  |
| System Administrator | Manages critical systems and requires privileged accounts; needs secure onboarding and session recording. | Onboarding, Recording |
| Database Administrator (DBA) | Manages critical databases with privileged accounts; addresses risks from unmanaged accounts (150 identified in 2024). | Onboarding, Recording |
| Application Owner | Owns business-critical applications; requires temporary privileged access via approval workflows to mitigate data leaks. | Onboarding, Approval |
| Financial Analyst | Accesses sensitive financial systems with elevated rights; requires secure onboarding and monitoring to prevent fraud. | Onboarding, Recording |
| IoT Manager | Oversees non-human identities (devices/workloads); ensures onboarding and monitoring under a Zero Trust framework. | Onboarding, Recording |
| Manager / Approver | Approves or rejects privileged access requests enterprise-wide; enforces least privilege and compliance requirements. | Approval |
| **Executive Stakeholders** |  |  |
| C-level (CFO / CTO) | May hold privileged access on critical systems and approve strategic requests; reviews audit reports for continuous verification and compliance. | Onboarding, Approval, Audit |
| **Security Stakeholders** |  |  |
| Security Auditor | Reviews session recordings and audit logs to evidence compliance (GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001). | Recording, Audit |
| PAM Administrator | Configures and operates CyberArk (Vault, PVWA, PSM); manages onboarding rules and approval workflows. | All use cases |
| PAM Support Team | Provides operational support and incident resolution to ensure PAM availability and performance. | All use cases |
| SOC Analyst | Monitors privileged session events via SIEM (e.g., Splunk) to enhance detection in a Zero Trust environment. | Recording, Audit |
| Cloud Architect | Designs hybrid/multi-cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) including IoT growth patterns. | Onboarding, Recording |
| **Compliance Stakeholders** |  |  |
| Legal / Compliance | Reviews policies, recordings, and logs for regulatory adherence (GDPR, NIS2, DORA, ISO 27001). | Audit |
| **HR / Identity Governance Stakeholders** |  |  |
| HR / IGA Administrator | Manages standard identities in HRIS/IGA and coordinates with PAM for privileged onboarding; ensures separation of standard vs. privileged accounts (SoD). | Onboarding (separation) |
