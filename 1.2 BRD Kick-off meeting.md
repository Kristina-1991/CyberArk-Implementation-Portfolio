## 1.2 BRD kick-off meeting

An initial meeting is organised with the CIO, the Project Lead, the IAM Engineer, the Senior Developer and the IAM Business Analyst. The purpose of this session is to assess the robustness of the company’s cybersecurity posture and to produce **BRD v0.1** (Business Requirements Document).

During the discussion, the CIO shares the following elements:

**1. The current IAM architecture**  
   The architecture consists of Workday as the source of truth (HRIS), SailPoint as the IGA platform, Active Directory as the central directory, Entra ID as IDP, and Splunk as the SIEM.

**2. The hybrid environment.**  
   In recent years, the company has adopted a hybrid (on-premises and multi-cloud) model to meet business needs and improve user experience.

**3. The growth of IoT in the hybrid environment.**  
   To support continuous improvement, the company has introduced IoT at scale. While this enables operational optimisation and responsible resource management, the integration of IoT in a hybrid context raises the attack surface and requires robust cybersecurity controls.

**4. Key conclusions from the internal audit and the 2024 incident report.**  
   Despite efforts to improve cybersecurity and remain competitive, the 2024 report highlights: an ineffective onboarding process for privileged accounts,generic and unmanaged accounts,gaps in authorisation and access control, and inefficient monitoring. The consequences of these issues are analysed in greater detail in the BRD.

**5. Compliance commitment.**  
   To move from medium to high cyber maturity, the company intends to align with ISO 27001, NIS2, DORA and GDPR requirements.

Based on these factors and their consequences, the team confirms that the **primary issue lies in the onboarding of privileged accounts**. On this basis, the team agree to focus the initial scope on implementing CyberArk as the privileged access management solution.

The CyberArk solution must reinforce the current environment and meet the following criteria:
- Implemented under a Zero Trust model.  
- Adaptable to a hybrid (multi-cloud) environment.  
- Able to scale with non-human identities (IoT devices) accessing critical resources.  
- Support modern protocols and standards end-to-end (OAuth2/OIDC, SAML, SCIM, LDAP/LDAPS, REST APIs).  
- Ensure identity data quality and synchronisation across the target architecture: source of truth (HRIS), IGA, AD, Entra, PAM (CyberArk), IDP and SIEM.  
- Guarantee that every control is auditable and that every decision is evidence-based.

The team identifies the following **business requirements**:
- **BR-01**: Semi-automated onboarding for all privileged accounts (including executives and IoT), with proper segregation.  
- **BR-02**: Just-in-Time approval workflow with continuous verification and password rotation.  
- **BR-03**: Session recording of privileged accounts.

A second meeting is held with the CIO to review BRD v0.1 and collect final remarks. After minor clarifications on scope and metrics, the BRD is validated and signed allowing the team to proceed with detailed design and CyberArk implementation planning.

*Note:* In this scenario, I chose to develop **three main business requirements** covering the major issues addressed.

## Why recommend implementing CyberArk to the client ?

During this meeting, all the issues identified were mainly due to poor privileged account management. CyberArk is a PAM (Privileged Account Management) solution. This type of solution secures, manages and monitors privileged accounts that have high access to sensitive information systems.
CyberArk acts as a secure access point between the end user with high privileges and critical resources. With CyberArk, the user can work on critical resources, but the solution isolates, monitors and can record the session.

The main objectives of this architecture are as follows:
- Prevent credential theft: the password is never visible to the end user.
- Monitor and audit sessions in real time
- Apply the principle of ‘zero privilege’, which consists of granting privileges only when necessary and for a limited period.  



## Scope

The working scope is limited to privileged accounts (human and non-human) on priority critical systems, with a company-wide impact under the Zero Trust model.


## Roles in this meeting

- **Project Lead**: delivery oversight; frames scope, timeline and constraints for the statement of work.  
- **IAM Engineer**: assesses technical feasibility and systems integrations (HRIS/IGA/AD/IDP/SIEM/PAM) in a hybrid multi-cloud context.  
- **Senior Developer**: highlights implementation constraints, performs effort sizing, and flags dependencies.  
- **IAM Business Analyst**: elicits and structures requirements, models processes, ensures traceability and evidence-by-design.
