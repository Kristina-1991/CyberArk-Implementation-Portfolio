# 3.2 Mitigation Plan
---
This plan closes the gaps identified in the BRD and Gap Analysis by linking each risk to a concrete mitigation, an accountable owner, a due date, and an evidence item. Each line maps to one or more Business Requirements (BR-00/01/02/03) and will be verified via UAT or Environment Readiness checks. Status is tracked until evidence is stored in the repository.
This plan includes mitigations for business/control gaps (R-01…R-09) and operational readiness enablers (R-10…R-16) required for successful delivery.

## Legend
- **Priority**: H/M/L (business + compliance impact)
- **Severity**: H/M/L (impact if it occurs)
- **Likelihood**: H/M/L (probability based on baseline)

## Dependencies & gating

- **Environment Readiness (8.0)** must be **PASS** before UAT:  
  SSO SAML/OIDC, ports, SIEM log path, backup/retention note, NTP skew, IGA delta sample, connector matrix, evidence index.  
- **Go/No-Go** requires: R-01…R-05 ✅ Done, R-06 evidence available, and any **Deferred** items documented in scope.
