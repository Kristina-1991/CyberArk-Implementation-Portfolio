# 3.2 Mitigation Plan
---
This section links each Gap from the Gap Analysis to the corresponding Mitigations in the plan, ensuring end-to-end traceability from problem to action and evidence.
Scope. Rows G1–G9 map to primary mitigations (R-01…R-09). Additional items R-10…R-16 are readiness/enablers (SSO, ports, SIEM, NTP, backup, stakeholder availability, deferred scope) that support multiple gaps and secure delivery quality.
Usage. Reviewers can follow: Gap → Mitigation(s) → UAT/Readiness checks → Evidence, which is “audit-ready” and decision-oriented for Go/No-Go.

## Legend
- **Priority**: H/M/L (business + compliance impact)
- **Severity**: H/M/L (impact if it occurs)
- **Likelihood**: H/M/L (probability based on baseline)

**Note.** “Due” = planned completion date; “Status” = ☐ Open / 🟡 In progress / ✅ Done (with evidence link). Update weekly during delivery.

## Crosswalk — Gap Analysis ↔ Mitigation Plan

| Gap (from Gap Analysis) | Mitigations addressing the gap |
|---|---|
| **G1 — Manual onboarding / ~20% errors** | **R-01** Discovery→Pending→Onboard · **R-07** Data quality cleanup · **R-08** Connector validation · **R-09** Port matrix/tests |
| **G2 — Shared / generic privileged accounts** | **R-02** Replace with named + separation · **R-07** Data quality rules/cleanup |
| **G3 — Credential theft / admin compromise** | **R-04** JIT + dual approval + time-box · **R-05** PSM recording · **R-13** Log/telemetry ingestion |
| **G4 — No authorization control (email-based)** | **R-04** PVWA JIT (SoD, dual approval) · **R-02** Separation std/priv |
| **G5 — Sensitive data leaks** | **R-02** Separation · **R-04** Policy-driven access · **R-05** Recording · **R-06** Control→Reg mapping |
| **G6 — Critical system outages (misconfigured rights)** | **R-01** Structured onboarding · **R-09** Network readiness · **R-08** Connector limits/fallbacks |
| **G7 — Insufficient session monitoring** | **R-05** PSM proxy/recording · **R-13** Centralized log pipeline |
| **G8 — Financial fraud via compromised admin** | **R-04** JIT controls · **R-05** Recording/traceability · **R-02** Named accounts · **R-06** Compliance evidence |
| **G9 — Non-compliance (fine)** | **R-06** Control-to-reg + ≥1y retention · **R-12** Backup/restore policy · **R-11** NTP/time integrity |


## Dependencies & gating

- **Environment Readiness (8.0)** must be **PASS** before UAT:  
  SSO SAML/OIDC, ports, SIEM log path, backup/retention note, NTP skew, IGA delta sample, connector matrix, evidence index.  
- **Go/No-Go** requires: R-01…R-05 ✅ Done, R-06 evidence available, and any **Deferred** items documented in scope.
