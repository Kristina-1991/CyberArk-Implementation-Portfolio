# Agile Management 

## 1. Product backlog

The Product Backlog consolidates all functional and non-functional requirements prioritized for delivery within the PAM implementation.  
From a Business Analyst perspective, it serves as the single, evolving repository of business value, ensuring that each item is clearly defined, estimated, and traceable to the organization’s strategic objectives (risk reduction, compliance, Zero Trust adoption).

In the context of the CyberArk solution implementation, backlog items were derived from the BRD and refined through stakeholder workshops.  
Each epic and story addresses a specific security control or operational need, such as privileged account onboarding, approval workflows, password rotation automation, and audit integration with SIEM.

The backlog was maintained iteratively in alignment with sprint goals and definition of Done (DoD) criteria, supporting transparent delivery and measurable progress toward the target PAM maturity model.

## User stories - Definition of done

The User Stories translate business and security requirements into actionable, testable units of work.  
Each story reflects a real-world interaction between a user and the PAM system, ensuring that technical implementation directly supports business outcomes.

From a BA perspective, the stories were structured using the INVEST model (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) and include acceptance criteria linked to UAT test cases (TU01–TU12).  
The user perspectives span multiple roles End-User, Approver, PAM Administrator, Security Analyst to validate both the operational workflow and compliance expectations.

Together, these stories bridge the gap between business intent and technical execution, enabling traceability from requirement definition (BRD) to validation (UAT) through a consistent Agile delivery framework.
